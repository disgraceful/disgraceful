### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate web developer with insatiable thrist for knowledge. I love creating solutions for my laziness, that can be usefull to others (i hope). For this I am using JavaScript/TypeScript. Also I used Vue.js, Vuex, Vuetify, Webpack, Firebase, Express.js, Axios & various APIs like Google, Twitter, Goodreads and many more! I am always looking forward learning something new and improve existing skills.

I am currently working on a project for administrating your "virtual" book library, called BookShelf. You can check the repositories right below this readme! I recently hosted it using Firebase Hosting! Check it out [here](https://bookshelf-a2203.web.app/)
